1. abstract class -> not a complete data abstraction
2. interface -> 100% data abstraction

abstract method()-> is a method, but it will not have any implementation 

abstract return type method(arguments);

if any class contains an abstract method then it is an abstract class

interface -> data abstraction and multiple inheritance

interface interface_name{
    data members;
    member functions(all the members functions must be abstract methods (not having any implementation))
}

static method and default method

packages and sub packages

packages -> to identify similar class and are organized in a place called structure(folder)

import java.util.Scanner; -> system defined packages

user defined packages
eg. let us have math as a package where addition is a class, subtraction is a class, similarly multiplication and division
